## 3D Printing Accuracy
My personal research on the objective 'best way' to get parts that I design to be 

CAD (Computer Aided Design) dimensions to align with the real world after they have
been printed.


3 Variables:
### 1) Intentional CAD Tolerances.
A CAD
### 2) STL -> GCODE Slicer settings.
### 3) Unique Printer Setup and Accuracy.
