## 3D Printing Quality
Documentation on what slicer and or slicer settings I use when printing different filaments at different qualities.

### Troubleshooting:
[SIMPLIFY3D](https://www.simplify3d.com/resources/print-quality-troubleshooting/): Great website for debugging issues.  
[ALL3DP](https://all3dp.com/1/common-3d-printing-problems-troubleshooting-3d-printer-issues/): Another good debug website.

### Working Printers:
- Elegoo Neptune 3 PRO, (On loan from [Maiikiru](https://github.com/Maiikiru)), Klipper integration
- Snapmaker J1s, Dual extrusion printer, Stock
### Various Stage of repair:
- Ender 3 V2, My OG Printer, 'broke' due to me half installing a klipper upgrade, I'll get to it.
- Ender 3, Bought Used, 'broke' due to a firmware misflash, I'll get to it.
