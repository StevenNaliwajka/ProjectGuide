### HYDROPONICS.

Growing of plants without soil.

In my idealized mind it's the most controlled form of gardening.  
Every piece of the puzzle can be controlled.  
Super nerdy but the "FTB Gardening Cloche" from modded minecraft caught my attention at a young age. The idea of being
able to automate food growth in such a small and tight format fascinated me.

My main thing I have grown so far as a 'proof of concept' has been lettuce.  
Though the goal for me was less about the actual growing but trying to re-design my system to be scalable.

There are a few stages so far in my journey. See the folders in the directory for notes and pictures.

1) Discovering an interest. (Aug 2022)
- Buckets of soil. Not much else.
2) V1 - The first design. (Mar 2023)
- A Vertical Proof of concept that could be scaled. 
- Moved from layer to layer through tubes. 
- VERY, VERY Noisy. Due to the tiny tubes.
3) V1.2 - Redesign of the ends. (July 2023)
- Attempted to solve the noise of the ends by using open gutter.
- Not having fixed ends caused it to be super leaky. Silicone was attempted to be used but this was just a mess.
4) V1.3 - Redesign of the ends (Sept 2023)
- Redesigned the ends again with fixed PVC connections using hard connected PVC Ts. 
- Expensive but quiet.
- Its fully enclosed, so it's practically impossible to clean.
4) V1.3.5 - Relocated. (March 2024)
- Relocated and disassembled for scraps. Redesigns are required.

It was a fun proof of concept. The parts have been scalped and salvaged. I have a metric ton of pvc 2" connections now.

Someday I plan to revisit this project with more of an emphasis on having cleaning and seed sowing automated.
