### Junior year of undergrad.   
Not my first time living away from family for an extended period of time but, but the first year housing at KSU was quite
drab. My signed photo of the now late senator Dianne Feinstein was not cutting it.

My solution was to grow some plants. 
### The beginning
I began with a bag of dirt and the drawers of a common plastic pull out bin and some cheap pink LED lights.

Lettuce was the crop of choice due to how much I liked it.

I also started some snap peas in a storage trunk I had brought. All good fun.

The issue came with me realizing I had to water them. I cant be bothered to manage that.

### The plan
Engineers fallacy, spending 100x more time on a solution to never have to think about it ever again.
