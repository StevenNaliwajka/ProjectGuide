# ProjectGuide
A centralized hub for documentation, indexing insights, methodologies and overviews of my professional and personal projects. 
As well as formal papers or presentations related to these topics.

Also Included is any formal papers/presentations on the topics.

Use the hyperlinks below for easy navigation.

Ordered by how cool they are (In my opinion...).
