The paper, "Multi-UAV Replacement and Trajectory Design for Coverage Continuity," presents a framework for ensuring uninterrupted wireless coverage in UAV-assisted communication systems. When a serving UAV runs out of energy, it is replaced by a fully charged UAV while maintaining maximal system performance. The proposed method optimizes the 3D trajectories of multiple UAVs, user associations, and resource allocation to maximize the system's achievable sum rate, all while considering practical constraints such as UAV velocity, energy consumption, and collision avoidance.

A non-convex optimization problem is formulated and solved using a low-complexity iterative algorithm. This algorithm decouples the problem into subproblems for optimizing user association, power allocation, and UAV trajectories. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms benchmark schemes, achieving higher system sum rates (up to 14% improvement) while adapting UAV paths based on user locations and energy constraints. The study also highlights the trade-offs between UAV velocity, energy consumption, and system performance.

This research can be applied to TVWS by leveraging the dynamic spectrum availability for UAV communication. It supports reliable connectivity in scenarios like disaster recovery, rural communications, and temporary networks, where uninterrupted coverage and efficient spectrum use are critical.
