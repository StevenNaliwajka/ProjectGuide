The paper, "Trajectory and Resource Allocation for UAV Replacement to Provide Uninterrupted Service," focuses on maintaining continuous wireless coverage using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in communication systems. It introduces a framework where a depleted UAV is replaced with a fully charged one while optimizing the 3D multi-UAV trajectory and resource allocation. The objective is to maximize the minimum achievable data rate for ground users while considering constraints like UAV energy, velocity, and collision avoidance.

Key contributions include:

    A novel UAV replacement framework ensuring uninterrupted service during transitions between UAVs.
    Optimization of trajectories and bandwidth allocation to enhance user throughput, considering realistic air-to-ground (A2G) channel models with both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS conditions.
    An iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve the non-convex optimization problem efficiently.

Numerical results demonstrate significant performance improvements over conventional methods, with the proposed scheme achieving higher data rates and better fairness among users. The study also provides insights into UAV trajectories and bandwidth allocation strategies during replacement scenarios.

This framework can be applied in TV White Space (TVWS) systems, leveraging the underutilized spectrum to optimize UAV-based communication. It supports dynamic spectrum access, enhancing connectivity in rural areas or during emergency scenarios where uninterrupted coverage is critical.
