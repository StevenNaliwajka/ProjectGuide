The paper, "Fairness-Aware Utility Maximization for Multi-UAV-Aided Terrestrial Networks," explores the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) into terrestrial communication systems to enhance coverage, capacity, and support for mobile users. It proposes a utility maximization framework that optimizes user scheduling, power allocation, and ABS deployment in the presence of co-channel interference. The paper also incorporates a fairness constraint, ensuring balanced resource distribution among users using Jain's fairness index.

A two-stage approach is presented: first, a heuristic initialization using clustering algorithms determines preliminary ABS locations and user associations. Second, an iterative interference-aware optimization refines these results, employing successive convex approximations to tackle the problemâ€™s non-convex nature. Numerical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving up to a 25% performance improvement over conventional schemes.

This methodology is particularly applicable to TV White Spaces (TVWS), leveraging their underutilized spectrum for enhanced UAV-ground communication. By optimizing ABS placement and interference management in TVWS, this approach can expand rural connectivity, provide disaster recovery solutions, and support high-demand urban scenarios. The fairness-aware design ensures equitable service distribution, making it ideal for diverse and dynamic network conditions.
