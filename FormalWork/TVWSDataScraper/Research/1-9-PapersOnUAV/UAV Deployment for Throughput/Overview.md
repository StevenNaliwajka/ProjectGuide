The paper, "UAV Deployment for Throughput Maximization in UAV-Assisted Cellular Communications," focuses on optimizing the 3D deployment of a single UAV acting as an aerial base station in a 5G cellular network. The objective is to maximize the total throughput (sum rate) for ground users distributed in a circular field while considering realistic air-to-ground channel conditions with both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components.

The study formulates the UAV deployment problem as a non-convex optimization task, which is challenging to solve directly. To address this, the authors approximate the rate expression and identify concave regions in the solution space. A low-complexity alternating optimization approach is proposed, leveraging methods like Golden Section Search (GSS) and linear search to find the UAV's optimal 3D location. Simulations validate the method, showing that it achieves throughput close to the globally optimal solution while being computationally efficient.

The results demonstrate that this approach outperforms traditional fixed-altitude or fixed-location methods, providing higher throughput and adaptability to user distribution. This research can integrate with TVWS by optimizing UAV placement to dynamically utilize underutilized spectrum, enhancing connectivity in scenarios like rural areas, disaster recovery, or high-demand urban environments.
