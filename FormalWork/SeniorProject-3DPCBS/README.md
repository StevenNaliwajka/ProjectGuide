## Summary
This project seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional PCB manufacturing by utilizing FDM 3D printers and 
conductive filaments to create functional PCBs. Mounting of components is done physically with superglue and 
electrically with colloidal silver paste. Research into the optimal sizing of traces has been conducted. After 
designing, printing and testing a prototype board that models a real-world example the group can confidently say that 
there is significant economic benefit to be realized by future research into the subject. While 3D printed boards are 
not going to show up overnight, they are possible and currently require trace sizes 3-4 times bigger than their copper 
counterparts. Future work into better conductive filament is being discussed. Partial work into, “FabFormat”, a solution 
to allow PCB design software to be used in development of 3D printed PCBs is also discussed. Every goal that was laid 
out was realized and more. The outcome is a scalable, low-cost method for rapid PCB prototyping, significantly reducing 
the time and expense typically associated with PCB production
